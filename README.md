# FHIR Works on AWS
The FHIR Works on AWS solution helps software engineers at independent software vendors,
system integrators, and healthcare information technology teams to enhance their own products.
Using this solution, they can transfer medical records to both mobile devices and web portals in
minutes rather than days or hours by integrating with the [Fast Healthcare Interoperability
Resources (FHIR)](https://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=491) standard APIs. The FHIR standard was developed by [Health Level Seven
International (HL7)](https://www.hl7.org/) to improve the exchange of health data between software systems such as
practice management, electronic health records, billing, and data exchange interfaces. It uses a
serverless FHIR API that supports FHIR resource types and operations to help healthcare providers
leverage the FHIR standard to manage healthcare records. It is a reference implementation,
designed to be extensible.
